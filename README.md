# CyberWriteups

## Write-ups Portion
Included here are a selection of write-ups for cyber challenges that I have solved while competing in intercollegiate competitions with the Cadet Competitive Cyber Team over the years.

Over the course of the last few years, I have solved hundreds of challenges in competitions. However, many of my write-ups exist on our team-internal repository, and I thought it more appropriate to just include a handful of write-ups that mostly pertain to cryptography, since that is the field I am most interested in.

Every write-up (and relevant challenge) in this repository was
* Solved entirely independently during competition
* Written and produced independently

### Summary of Folders and Contents

 - CSAW2019
	 - "Byte Me" - a challenge involving an AES-ECB exploit
 - CSAW2020
	 - "Adversarial" - A challenge involving AES-CTR and a crib-dragging exploit
	 - "Modus Operandi" - A challenge involving distinguishing between AES-CBC and AES-ECB, and interacting with a server using pwntools
 - CyberCup2019
	 - "Lefty" - Producing a desired output using an esoteric language
 - metaCTF2021
	 - "Unbreakable Encryption" - Very basic one-time pad exploit for a reused key
 - picoCTF2021
	 - "New Vigenère" - a challenge involving the exploitation of a type of Vigenère cipher. Involves applying Kasiski analysis and other cryptanalysis.

## Independent Study PDF
Also included is a PDF of my independent study, which I will be completing after finishing data collection this semester. Robotics and motion control is something that I have been interested in since high school. While this is not immediately relevant to my capability as a developer in the cyber branch, I think it may be useful to see as a reference for my technical background and problem solving ability.
